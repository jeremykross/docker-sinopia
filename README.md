## What is the Containership Marketplace?

The Containership marketplace is a series of containerized applications configured to easily run and scale on a [containership.io](https://containership.io) cluster! Many conveniences such as High-Availability, automatic clustering among others are able to be configured out of the box allowing you to scale seamlessly as your infrastructure is required to grow.

> **Note:** If you attempt to run this image outside of a containership cluster, we cannot guarantee that it will run properly.
